        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Raphael Chung, an IT and security analyst who just graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. My journey into the world of IT started in high school with a fascination inspired by my friend's work in information security.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've worked in full-stack development for my projects, proficient in a number of web development tools and constantly practicing the newest technologies in order to stay ahead of the industry. I'm also currently studying for my Security+ certification, so hit me up if you want to quiz each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            When not dealing with coding, I'm usually reading about new foods or diving into some books. I also play quite a few video games with friends or through LFG.
        </p>
        <p>
            Feel free to see my portfolio for the projects that I've worked on so far. Please don't be shy and feel free to reach out if you want to talk about anything!
        </p>
