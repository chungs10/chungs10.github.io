      <h3>OUR MISSION STATEMENT</h3>
      <p>
        Museo strives to make it easier to remember those explorative moments
        that matter most, and capture the appeal of physical media in a more
        accessible way. We get you offline longer, and keep you curious just 
        like you were as a child! We also encourage parents to start MUSEO 
        accounts for their children so they'll always have something to remember
        their museum visits by.
