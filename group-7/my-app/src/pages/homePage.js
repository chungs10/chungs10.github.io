              sellingText2="All of our stamps are unique to museums, thus it follows that limited run exhibits will also be unique and unavailable after the museum itself closes the exhibit's doors. Tickets are a fickle thing, they can get lost in the washing machine, get wet and disintegrate, or fall out on a train or bus, never to be seen again, but Museo keeps all of your normal exhibit tickets and limited run exhibits so you never have to worry about forgetting an experience because you lost a piece of paper."

It makes it easier to trade stories, give recommendations, and plan trips to visit more museums and collect more stamps."
              sellingText2="We are a social media that encourages getting offline. As you collect more stamps and stickers, you visit more museums, and in turn get to show your friends the places you've been. Our memory book is designed to be shown and passed around, an achievement to be proud of. We make sure that you have a platform to collect and share all of those museum experiences that you can unplug for and hold dear."
