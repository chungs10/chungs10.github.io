        <h2>Myanmar Twitter Analysis Project</h2>
        <p>
            This project focused on analyzing Twitter conversations related to Myanmar's military actions. Using the T.A.G.S bot (Twitter Archiving Google Sheet), I was able to collect and analyze thousands of tweets, with a particular focus on identifying fact-based posts versus opinion-based ones. This analysis provided significant insights into how the situation was being discussed online, making it easier to understand the larger social media narrative around the topic.
            <br><br>
            The first phase of the project involved setting up the T.A.G.S bot to collect tweets based on keywords relevant to Myanmar's political landscape. After gathering the data for about a month, we then stopped our data collection and started to filter out unimportant data. A key component of this phase was filtering out irrelevant data and ensuring the dataset was manageable.
            <br><br>
            In the second phase, we conducted a deeper sentiment analysis, distinguishing between factual reporting and opinionated content. This analysis helped to identify key influencers, frequently discussed topics, and trends within the Twitter data, contributing to a better understanding of public sentiment regarding the Myanmar situation.
            <br><br>
            The final phase involved preparing a detailed report, summarizing the findings. The report highlighted key patterns in online discourse, such as peaks in discussions, commonly used hashtags, and how news spread through retweets and replies, along with identifying misinformation from third party sources that came from places outside of Myanmar.
            <br><br>
            This project involved significant work in data analysis, report writing, and creating visualizations to help convey the results effectively. It demonstrated how data from social media platforms like Twitter can be harnessed to provide insights into political and social issues.
