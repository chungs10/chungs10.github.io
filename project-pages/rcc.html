        <h2>Rensselaer Cybersecurity Collaboratory Project</h2>
        <p>For the RCC of RPI, a club dedicated to researching and perfecting cybersecurity, we were tasked with three phases.
            The first phase was a public facing website to advertise the Rensselaer Cyber Collaboratory and increase its presence
            in the Internet aside from being just in RPI. Donation pages and Login pages were created so that certified personnel can
            log in, although their functions were not expanded on for security reasons. Event page was created so that the RCC
            would have an easier time coordinating events and also be able to invite other potential recruits into the RCC.
            <br><br>
            The second phase was the creation of the backend regarding the upload and viewing of Capture The Flag writeups. The RCC 
            frequently participates in the National Cyber League, a cybersecurity competition. These writeups are to be practice for the
            National Cyber League, giving users early practice. Uploading writeups made by other students and able to view them is the purpose
            of Phase 2.
            <br><br>
            For Phase 3, it was the creation of the figma that showed the future frontend in conjunction with the backend created in 
            Phase 2. This is the prototype blueprint for the final result of the site that would allow students and registered participants
            to practice and perfect their cybersecurity skills for the National Cyber League. This site would include a list of writeups for students
            to choose and topics for easy filtering along with a chat system that allowed fellow users to communicate with each others.
